## Basic Guidelines

### Always test your changes.

Do not submit something without at least navigating around the website to see if it works as expected. If you are submitting a new function, make sure it has a name and description, and that it works correctly. If you are changing existing functions, test them out first.

### Do not make large changes before discussing them first.

If you are interested in adding a large feature or changing large amounts of code, first contact Jeff Horsburgh via email (jeff.horsburgh@usu.edu). For most changes, this should not be necessary. We just want to know if you're doing something big so we can offer advice and/or make sure you're not wasting your time on it.

### Do not make formatting PRs.

While we appreciate the keen eyes of our contributors, please refrain from submitting Pull Requests solely for minor formatting fixes, such as trailing spaces, extra newlines, or empty indents.

If you're working on a PR that introduces or modifies actual code, you're welcome to correct any formatting issues you come across in the areas you're working on. This approach helps us maintain a focused and efficient review process.

## Style Guidelines

### Follow the programming language's conventions

This means if you're writing new code in TypeScript, use the TypeScript conventions. If you're writing Python code, use the Python conventions, etc.
